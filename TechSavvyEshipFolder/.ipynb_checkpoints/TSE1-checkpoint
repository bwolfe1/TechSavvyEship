Design Thinking:
    Learn from People
    Find Patterns
    Define Design Principles
        'social intractions at all times'
    Make Tangible
    Iterate Relentlessly
    
    How might we...?
    
    Empathy: listen to and observe target market
    Define the Problem: prioritize needs
    Ideate: brainstorm:
        defer judgement, generate/build on (even wild) ideas, stay focused 
        on topic, one mic, be visual, go for quantity 
    Prototype: build short low cost iterations, know what needs they meet
    Test: show don't tell, let user use and observe, compare prototypes
    
    3 step process:
    immerse, ideate, implement
    
    ITERATE and BE AGILE
    
Agile Development:
    
    Do not use: 
        simple development
        complicated expert tasks
        chaotic situations/emergencies
    Do Use:
        new product
        new idea
    
    Product Backlog: All tasks 
    Sprint Backlog: All tasks for sprint
    Current Sprint: What we are doing right now
    To Do: short simple tasks
